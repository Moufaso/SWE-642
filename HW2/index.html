         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>
            &emsp; With nearly 80 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in
            the College of Engineering and Computing, one of the largest departments on campus, and the largest,
            fastest growing, and highest ranked Computer Science department in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp; The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs with a total enrollment of over 2200
            students: the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; four
            M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software
            Engineering with a total enrollment of almost 1000 students; and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with
            nearly 200 students. The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S.
            in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of
            Engineering.
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp; The department has a world-class faculty with research strengths in all areas of computing, and a
            strong commitment to teaching. Nearly half of our faculty were recruited in the past three years, and we
            now rank among the Top 40 Computer Science Departments in the US. Our faculty are engaged in leading edge
            research in their respective fields and have authored widely used textbooks and software. Our faculty's
            excellence is reflected in the awards we have received for our research (27 NSF CAREER and AFOSR Young
            Investigator awards, 7 Mason Emerging Researcher awards) and teaching (8 Mason Excellence in Teaching
            awards), and our faculty include three ACM Fellows and five IEEE Fellows.
